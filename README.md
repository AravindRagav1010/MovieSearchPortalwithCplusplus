# Movie Search Portal using C++
In this project, we created a movie search portal using the concepts of File Handling in C++, where the user will be able to create their credentials to log in to their profile and search for films based on different classes such as genre, medium, etc to view the details of each film. The user can change his credentials using the forgot password option to log in again if they forget the credentials.  
We were able to create separate login credentials for the admin, which will allow them to enter the films according to the classes in the files.  
We were able to create a User Interface that mimics the process that takes place in logging into a movie streaming portal in terms of selecting plans, payment methods, etc.
